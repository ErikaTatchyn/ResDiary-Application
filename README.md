Explanation:

The function takes an array and the number of divisions (N) as parameters.
It initializes an empty result array to store the divided arrays.
It calculates the chunkSize by dividing the length of the array by N and rounding up to the nearest integer. This ensures that the divided arrays are as equal in size as possible.
It sets the initial index to 0.
It enters a loop that iterates until the index reaches the length of the array.
In each iteration, it uses the slice method to extract a chunk of the array starting from the current index and with a length equal to chunkSize.
It pushes the chunk to the result array.
It increments the index by chunkSize to move to the next chunk.
After the loop finishes, it returns the result array containing the divided arrays.
The code handles cases where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N by allocating the remaining elements to the last divided array. This is achieved by using the Math.ceil function to round up the chunkSize and ensure that the last array accommodates any remaining elements.
